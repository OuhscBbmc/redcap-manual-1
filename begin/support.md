# Help and Support {#sec-begin-support}

**Chapter Leads**: Thomas Wilson

## Support Tickets {#sec-begin-support-tickets}

## Office Hours {#sec-begin-support-office}

The OU REDCap teams hosts online office hours on Tuesday (10:30-11:30am) and Thursday (10:30-11:30am) most weeks.
But this is subject to change, so check with Thomas if it is important.
Please contact [Thomas](mailto:thomas-wilson@ouhsc.edu) for the Zoom link.

All are welcome to join,
from experienced project admins wanting to tweak an existing feature,
to newly-hired data entry personnel wanting to be more comfortable with an unfamiliar assignment.
Experienced vets are willing to help with most questions.

No PHI is shared during office hours,
because people from different projects won't necessarily be permitted to see your participant data.
If possible, create a test record to your project for the sake of the meeting.
This will allow attendees to see and learn from your question.

## Embedded Resources {#sec-begin-support-embedded}

The REDCap interface itself offers links to documentation...

## Callout -tip

Knowledge of biomedical, translational, and clinical data standards is essential for appropriate use of the coded RWD when curating concept sets to apply to the data.
Ultimately, that in combination with data availability and data limitations will determine project feasibility.
